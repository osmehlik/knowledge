# How to take notes on Ubuntu?

## Textual notes

I recommend use [Zim](https://zim-wiki.org/). See [screenshots](https://zim-wiki.org/screenshots.html).

Features:

- easy to use
- uses a folder containing files in custom plain-text format as a file format
- you edit your notes in a visual way (as in Microsoft Office or LibreOffice), you usually don't interact with underlying file format
- works on Windows, Linux, Mac

You can install Zim on Ubuntu using the following command:

```bash
sudo apt install zim
```

If you do not like Zim, you can try the following alternatives:

- [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/)
    - uses a folder containing markdown files as a file format
    - you work with the underlying file format

## Graphical notes

You can use xournal app for taking notes using graphical tablet and stylus.

You can install xournal using the following command:

```bash
sudo apt install xournal
```
