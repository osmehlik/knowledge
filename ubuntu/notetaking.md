# How to take notes in Ubuntu?

I recommend these applications for notetaking:

- [Zim](https://zim-wiki.org/)
    - uses a folder containing files in custom plain-text format as a file format
    - you edit your notes in a visual way, you usually don't interact with underlying file format
- [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/)
    - uses a folder containing markdown files as a file format
    - you work with the underlying file format

Both these applications are cross-platform and work on Windows, Linux and Mac, so you can use them even if you have to use other operating system. :)
