**This guide is intended for advanced users.**

You can make presentations in LaTeX using Beamer class.

You can install everything related to LaTeX using
the following command:

```bash
sudo apt install texlive-full
```

I recommend using [TeXstudio](https://www.texstudio.org/)
as an integrated development environment for LaTeX documents.
You can install TeXstudio using the following command:

```bash

I recommend using
[template inspired by default template from Keynote](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/%7Eucbpeal/latexposter.html),
which is a software for making presentations available
on Apple's macOS operating system.

You can find tutorials about Beamer
