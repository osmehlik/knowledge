**This guide is intended for advanced users.**

You can make presentations in LaTeX using Beamer class.

You can install everything related to LaTeX using
the following command:

```bash
sudo apt install texlive-full
```

I recommend using [TeXstudio](https://www.texstudio.org/)
as an integrated development environment for LaTeX documents.
You can install TeXstudio using the following command:

```bash
