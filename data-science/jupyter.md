# How To Start Using Jupyter On Ubuntu?

## Installation

There are more options.

Probably the simplest is to install [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com) distribution.

It is used for creating named environments with Python packages.

Default environment named `base` should contain installed jupyter-lab.

## Usage

1. Navigate to your directory with jupyter notebooks in terminal.
    - If you don't have any jupyter notebooks files, just create an empty directory and navigate to it in terminal.
2. Run `jupyter-lab`
    - It should open the web interface of Jupyter lab in browser.
    - In left panel, you can browse the content of the directory from which you ran `jupyter-lab` command.
3. You can stop `jupyter-lab` by pressing CTRL+C in terminal from which you ran `jupyter-lab` command.
